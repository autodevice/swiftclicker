# SwiftClicker - Technical Implementation Notes

> **Note**: This document contains the original implementation planning notes. For current development context, see `CLAUDE.md`.

## Project Status: ✅ COMPLETED & TESTED

SwiftClicker is a **fully functional** Swift implementation of a uiautomator2 client. Successfully tested with real Android emulator performing all touch and key input events.

## Key Technical Discoveries

### Server Architecture Reality
The original plan assumed a simple HTTP client would suffice. **Key discovery**: uiautomator2 requires complete server lifecycle management:

1. **JAR Deployment**: Must download and deploy 3.7MB `u2.jar` to device
2. **Server Process**: Must start with specific command: `CLASSPATH=/data/local/tmp/u2.jar app_process / com.wetest.uia2.Main`
3. **Port Management**: ADB port forwarding required for localhost access
4. **Process Cleanup**: Server must be properly stopped to free resources

### Communication Protocol - IMPLEMENTED
```swift
// Touch Events → JSON-RPC mapping (WORKING)
ACTION_DOWN = 0, ACTION_UP = 1, ACTION_MOVE = 2
injectInputEvent(action, x, y, 0)

// Key Events → JSON-RPC mapping (WORKING)  
pressKey("home") / pressKeyCode(4)
```

### Final Architecture - AS BUILT

## Testing Results - SUCCESSFUL ✅

Demo application successfully executed:
- ✅ **Server Setup**: Auto-download, deploy JAR, start server
- ✅ **Touch Events**: down, move, up, click, longPress, swipe
- ✅ **Key Events**: home, back, menu, volume keys
- ✅ **Cleanup**: Proper server shutdown and resource cleanup

## Implementation vs. Original Plan

| Original Plan | Actual Implementation | Status |
|---------------|----------------------|---------|
| Simple HTTP client | Full server lifecycle management | ✅ Enhanced |
| Manual server setup | Automated JAR deployment | ✅ Automated |
| Basic touch/key events | Complete input event suite + convenience methods | ✅ Extended |
| Connection testing | Robust retry logic with troubleshooting | ✅ Enhanced |

## Critical Code Locations

**Server Management**: `Sources/SwiftClicker/ServerManager.swift`
- JAR download from GitHub releases
- ADB command execution
- Server process lifecycle

**Main API**: `Sources/SwiftClicker/Device.swift`  
- User-facing API
- Connection logic with auto-setup
- Touch event fluent API

**Communication**: `Sources/SwiftClicker/HTTPClient.swift`
- JSON-RPC 2.0 implementation
- Ping testing and error handling

## Original Requirements: FULLY MET

✅ **Touch Events**: down, up, move - WORKING
✅ **Key Events**: press by name and code - WORKING  
✅ **Demo Application**: Complete working demo - SUCCESSFUL
